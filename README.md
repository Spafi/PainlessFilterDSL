# Painless Filter DSL

Painless Filter DSL is a utility service designed to ease the task of creating and handling dynamic filtering, sorting and pagination for Spring Data JPA with the use of QueryDSL. This library abstracts the complexity of creating predicates for filtering, sorting and pagination operations for any entity class.

The goal of this service is to provide an easy-to-use, maintainable, and extendable way of implementing complex queries in your Spring Data applications.

## Usage

### 1. Filtering

Filtering in Painless Filter DSL is based on the `FilterRequest` objects. These are simple data objects that specify the column to be filtered, the type of the field, the operation to be performed, and the value(s) to filter.

Filtering operations such as `EqualOperation`, `NotEqualOperation`, `ContainsOperation`, `StartsWithOperation`, `EndsWithOperation`, `DateBeforeOperation`, `DateAfterOperation`, `InListOperation`, `NotInListOperation` are implemented in this library.

Here is an example of how to use them:

```kotlin
val filterRequest = FilterRequest(
    columnPath = "column_name",
    fieldType = FieldType.STRING,
    operation = EqualOperation(),
    value = "value_to_filter"
)
```

### 2. Sorting

Sorting is done by using `SortRequest` objects. These objects specify the column to be sorted and the direction of sorting. The direction can be ascending (`AscOperation`) or descending (`DescOperation`).

Here is an example of creating a `SortRequest`:

```kotlin
val sortRequest = SortRequest(
    columnPath = "column_name",
    direction = AscOperation()
)
```

### 3. Pagination

Pagination is handled via the `buildPageRequest` function in `FilteringService` which takes sorting order, page size, and page number as arguments and returns a `PageRequest` object:

```kotlin
val pageRequestOutcome = FilteringService.buildPageRequest(
    sortOrder = listOf(sortRequest),
    pageSize = 10,
    pageNumber = 0
)
```

### 4. Combining Filters, Sorting and Pagination

The `validateAndAddOptionalFilters` function in `FilteringService` can be used to add optional filters to an `IEntityFilterAndSortPageRequest` and return a `FilteredSortedPageRequest`.

```kotlin
val outcome = FilteringService.validateAndAddOptionalFilters(
    entityFilterAndSortPageRequest = entityFilterAndSortPageRequest,
    additionalFilters = filterRequest1, filterRequest2
)
```

This will return an `Outcome<FilteredSortedPageRequest>` that can then be used to perform a filtered, sorted, and paginated query.

Please note that before using Painless Filter DSL, you should set up QueryDSL in your project, and the entities should have corresponding Q-classes generated by QueryDSL.
